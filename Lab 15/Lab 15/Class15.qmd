## Background

Pertussis, a.k.a. whooping cough, is a highly infectious launch disease cuased by the bacteria *B. Pertussis*

The CDC tracks pertussis case numbers per year. Let's have a closer look at this [data](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html):

We will use the `datapasta` R package to "scrape" this data into R. 


> Q1.  With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called `cdc` and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.



```{r}

baseplot

```


Add some landmark development as annotation to our plot. We include the first whole-cell (wP) vaccine roll-out in 1946. 
```{r}
baseplot +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, linetype = "dashed", col = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1948, y = 1, label = "wP"), color = "red", vjust = -30) 
```

Let's add the switch to acellular vaccine (aP). 
> Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?


```{r}
baseplot +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, linetype = "dashed", col = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, linetype = "dashed", col = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1998, y = 1, label = "aP"), color = "blue", vjust = -30)+
  geom_text(aes(x = 1948, y = 1, label = "wP"), color = "red", vjust = -30) +
  theme_test()
```

> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

We went from ~200,000 cases pre-wP vaccine to ~1,000 cases in 1976. 

The US switched to the aP vaccine in 1995. We start to see a big increase in 2004 to ~26,000 cases. 

There is a ~10 year lag from aP roll-out to increasing case numbers. This holds true of other countries like Japan, UK, etc. 
It seems that something about the aP vaccine that has a immune response that does not last as long as the wP vaccine.


**Key Question: ** Why does the aP vaccine induced immunity wane faster than that of the wP vaccine?

## CMI-PB

The CMI-PB (Computation Models of Immunity Pertussis Boost) makes available lost of data about the immune response to Pertussis booster vaccination. 

Critically, it tracks wP and aP individuals over time to see how their immune response changes. 

CMI-PB make all their data freely available via JSON format tables from their databas.

Let's read the first one of these tables:

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v5/subject", simplifyVector = T)

head(subject)
```

> Q1. How many subjects are there in this dataset?


```{r}
nrow(subject)
```

> Q4. How many aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```


> Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q. Does this do a good job of representing the US populus?

No way

Let's get more data from CMI-PB, this time about the specimens collected. 

```{r}
specimen <- read_json("https://cmi-pb.org/api/v5/specimen", simplifyVector = T)
```


Now we can join (merge) these two tables `subject` and `specimen` to make one new `meta` table with the combined data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
meta <- inner_join(subject, specimen)
head(meta)
```
Now read an "experiment data" table from CMI-PB
```{r}
abdata <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v5/plasma_ab_titer", simplifyVector = T)

head(abdata)
```
> Q. What are the different $dataset values in abdata and what do you notice about the number of rows for the most “recent” dataset?

```{r}
# str(ab)
# table(abdata$specimen_id)
```
There are 1497 specimen_ids each have 35 or 80 rows. 

One more join to do of `meta` and `abdata` to associate all the metadata about the individual and their race, biological sex, and infancy vaccination status together with Antibody levels...

```{r}
ab <- inner_join(abdata, meta)
head(ab)
```

> Q. Hwo many Ab measurements do we have? 

```{r}
nrow(ab)
```

How many isotypes

```{r}
table(ab$isotype)

```

How many antigens?
```{r}
table(ab$antigen)
```
Let's focus in on IgG - one of the main antibody types responsive to bacteria or virial infections

```{r}
igg <- filter(ab, isotype == "IgG")
head(igg)
```

Make a first plot of MFI (Mean Flourescence Intensity - a measure of how much is detected) for each antigen. 


```{r}
ggplot(igg, aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col = infancy_vac)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


> Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels for all antigens:

```{r}
ggplot(igg, aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col = infancy_vac)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~visit)
```

> Q14.  What antigens show differences in the level of IgG1 antibody titers recognizing them over time? Why these and not others?

Antigens PT, PRN, FIM2/3, and FHA show differences in the level of IgG antibody titers (MFI) over time. The Terminology search function is still under development. But, I can guess that these four antigens are more influential to the main pertussis toxin. 

```{r}
table(igg$visit)
```

Exclude visits 8~12. Focus on the first 7 visits.
Looks like we don't have data yet for all subjects in terms of visits 8 onwards. So let's exclude these. 

```{r}
igg_7 <- filter(igg, visit %in% 1:7)
table(igg_7$visit)
```

```{r}
ggplot(igg_7, aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col = infancy_vac)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~visit
             , ncol = 2)
```

Let's try a different plot. First focus on one antigen, start with PT (Pertussis Toxin) and plot visit or time on the x-axis and MFI_normalised on the y-axis. 

```{r}
igg_7 %>% 
  filter(antigen == "PT", dataset == "2020_dataset") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(planned_day_relative_to_boost, MFI_normalised, group = subject_id) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) 
```

Must filter to a single year. 





```{r}
abdata.21 <- ab %>% filter(dataset == "2021_dataset")

abdata.21 %>% 
  filter(isotype == "IgG",  antigen == "PT") %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x=planned_day_relative_to_boost,
        y=MFI_normalised,
        col=infancy_vac,
        group=subject_id) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept=14, linetype="dashed") +
  labs(title="2021 dataset IgG PT",
       subtitle = "Dashed lines indicate day 0 (pre-boost) and 14 (apparent peak levels)")
```

Let's finish here for today. We are beginning to see some interesting differences between aP and wP individuals. There is likely lots of other interesting things to find in this dataset...

```{r}
#| message: false
library(lubridate)

```
